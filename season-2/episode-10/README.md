# Episode 10

Here are the files used in the start of the 10th episode of code{}school season 2.

The library that is used is called raylib.

https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/archive/2.6.0.zip

Use this link to download version 2.6 (which is the one used in the episode) and unzip it. Within the zip file is a Projects folder and within that one is VS2017. Open that .sln file, compile the whole solution and then hit F5.

What we then did is to add the files from this folder as existing files to the C++ project. And replace the code within the existing `core_basic_window.cpp` file with the one in this folder.

It's not the cleanest way to create a project or to add files, but it's enough to get you going and to play around with code and learn.

I hope you learn something and please remember to join our discord for some discussions about programming and games.
